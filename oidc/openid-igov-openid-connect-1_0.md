# Abstract

The OpenID Connect protocol defines an identity federation system that allows
a relying party to request and receive authentication and profile information
about an end user.

This specification profiles the OpenID Connect protocol to increase baseline
security, provide greater interoperability, and structure deployments in a
manner specifically applicable to (but not limited to) government and public
service domains **in the Netherlands**.

This profile builds on top of, and inherits all properties of, the OAUTH
profile for iGov **in the Netherlands ("iGov-NL")**.

**iGov-NL**

# Dutch government Assurance profile for OpenID Connect
This profile is based upon the international government assurance profile for OpenID Connect (iGov) [iGov.OIDC] as published by the OpenID Foundation (https://openid.net/foundation/). It should be considered a fork of this profile as the iGov profile is geared more towards the American situtation and in the Netherlands we have to deal with an European Union and specific Dutch context. 

We have added the chapter [Usecases](#Usecases) to illustrate the specific usecase the iGov-NL profile is aimed at. Starting with chapter [Introduction](#Introduction) we follow the structure of the iGov profile. Where we do not use content from iGov we use ~~strikethrough~~ to indicate it is not part of iGov-NL. Where we have added more specific requirements for the Dutch situation this is indicated with **iGov-NL** tags or **bold** for minor changes.
Note: examples in the original iGov profile are sometimes inconsistent or even invalid, these have been corrected without explicit formatting in this profile along with other changes.

As in the original iGov OpenID Connect profile, this profile focuses on a Relying Party also known as a Client.
As OpenID Connect is not explicitly applicable to Resource Servers, these are left out of scope.
Please refer to the iGov-NL profile for a profile dealing with interactions between Resource Servers and Authorization Servers.

Note that this profile does not detail all steps in the protocol flow, nor each option and parameter.
For further details the [iGov-NL.OAuth2] profile and OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications are applicable.

# Use case
The generic use case where this profile can be applied, is very similar to the use case for the iGov-NL OAuth2 profile. A Client application wishes to identify _and authenticate_ a User and may additionally want to receive User attributes from a trusted party. Authenticating the User is in addition to the use case for the OAuth2 iGov-NL profile.

Clients are restricted to web-applications in this version of the profile. Future updates may add support for native applications.
Next to identification and authentication, a Client may want to receive attributes that are more reliable than those self-claimed by the User.

# Flow for identification and authentication
The flow starts identical to the use case flow of the iGov-NL OAuth2 profile. As with iGov-NL OAuth2, only the authorization code flow is used in this profile.
Step 1 to 5 of that profile can be applied as-is, with the distinction that the Authorization Request explicitly is an _Authentication_ Request.

Step 6 will result in an Access Token and ID Token. The Access Token can be used in a UserInfo Request or in requests to a Resource Server as in regular OAuth2.

In addition to making a token Request to receive an ID Token, the Client can make a UserInfo Request. This request can be used to obtain additional information about the User.

Step 7 (OAuth2) is optional or implied. The Relying Party (= Client) can use the authentication result directly -- effectively resulting in resource server integrated in the Client -- or can make requets to a Resource Server using the obtained Access Token as in the OAuth2 use case.

#  1. Introduction

Government regulations for permitting users (citizens and non-citizens) online
access to government resources vary greatly from region to region. There is a
strong desire to leverage federated authentication and identity services for
public access to government resources online to reduce 'password fatigue',
increase overall account security, reduce cost**s**, and provide reliable identity
assurances from established and trusted sources when applicable.

This specification aims to define an OpenID Connect profile that provides
governments with a foundation for securing federated access to public services
online.
**This document is derived from the iGov profile by the OpenID Foundation.**

##  1.1. Requirements Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 .

All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) data
structures in this specification utilize the JWS Compact Serialization or the
JWE Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON Serialization and the JWE JSON
Serialization are not used.

##  1.2. Terminology

This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization Code",
"Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
"Client", "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Client Secret",
"Grant Type", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token",
"Resource Owner", "Resource Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint"
defined by OAuth 2.0 , the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON Web
Token (JWT)" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) , and the terms defined by OpenID
Connect Core 1.0 .

##  1.3. Conformance

This specification defines requirements for the following components:

  * OpenID Connect 1.0 relying parties (also known as OpenID Clients) 
  * OpenID Connect 1.0 identity providers (also known as OpenID Providers) 

The specification also defines features for interaction between these
components:

  * Relying party to ~~identity~~ **OpenID** provider

When an iGov-**NL**-compliant component is interacting with other iGov-**NL**-compliant
components, in any valid combination, all components MUST fully conform to the
features and requirements of this specification. All interaction with non-iGov-**NL**
components is outside the scope of this specification.

An iGov-**NL**-compliant OpenID ~~Connect IdP~~ **Provider** MUST support all features as described in
this specification. A general-purpose ~~IdP~~ **OpenID Provider** MAY support additional features for
use with non-iGov-**NL** clients.

An iGov-**NL**-compliant OpenID ~~Connect IdP~~ **Provider** MAY also provide iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0
authorization server functionality. In such cases, the authorization server
MUST fully implement the OAuth 2.0 iGov-**NL** profile. If an iGov-compliant OpenID
~~Connect IdP~~ **Provider** does not provide iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server
services, all features related to interaction between the authorization server
and protected resource**s** are therefore OPTIONAL.

An iGov-**NL**-compliant OpenID Connect client MUST ~~use~~ **implement** all ~~functions~~ **requirements** as described in
this specification. A general-purpose client library MAY support additional
features for use with non-iGov-**NL** IdPs.

#  2. Relying Party Profile

##  2.1. Requests to the Authorization Endpoint (Authentication Request)

The iGov-**NL** OAuth2 profile specifies requirements for requests to Authorization
Endpoints - for example, when to use the PKCE parameters to secure token
exchange.

In addition to the requirements specified in Section ~~2.1.1~~ **1.3.3.1** of the iGov-**NL** OAuth2
profile, the following describes the supported OpenID Connect Authorization
Code Flow parameters for use with iGov-**NL** compatible ~~IdPs~~ **OpenID Providers**.

Request Parameters:

<dl>

<dt>client_id</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier valid at the Authorization Server. </dd>

<dt>response_type</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. MUST be set to code.</dd>

<dt>scope</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. Indicates the attributes being requested. (See below)</dd>

<dt>redirect_uri</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. Indicates a valid endpoint where the client will receive the authentication response. See (<b>OpenID</b> core section 3.1.2.1)</dd>

<dt>state</dt>

<dd>REQUIRED. Unguessable random string generated by the client, used to protect against CSRF attacks. Must contain a sufficient amount of entropy to avoid guessing. Returned<b>, unchanged,</b> to the client in the ID Token.</dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**

Vectors of Trust are not actively used in the iGov-NL profile, as Europe uses level-of-assurance (LoA) policies which have a better fit with `acr`.

**/iGov-NL**

<dl>

<dt>vtr</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. MUST be set to a value as described in Section 6.1 of Vectors of Trust vtr takes precedence over acr_values.</dd>

<dt>acr_values</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. Lists the acceptable LoAs for this authentication. See (below). MUST not be set if vtr is specified.</dd>

<dt>code_challenge and code_challenge_method</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. If the PKCE protocol is being used by the client. See OAUTH profile for iGov-<b>NL</b>.</dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**

Note that a `redirect_uri` MUST be pre-registered with the OpenID Provider as described in the OAuth2 iGov-NL profile.

**/iGov-NL**

A sample request may look like:

    https://op.example.nl/oidc/authorization?
      response_type=code
      &client_id=827937609728-m2mvqffo9bsefh4di90saus4n0diar2h
      &scope=openid
      &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Frp.example.nl%2Foidc%2FloginResponse
      &state=2ca3359dfbfd0
	  &nonce=9d3252993a38454c8a6c3a4b86997aaa
      &acr_values=http%3A%2F%2Feidas.europa.eu%2FLoA%2Fsubstantial
    

##  2.2. Requests to the Token Endpoint

In addition to the requirements specified in Section ~~2.1.2~~ **1.3.3.3** of the iGov-**NL** OAuth2
profile, the following ~~claims~~ **parameters** MUST be included:

The following parameters are specified:

<dl>

<dt>grant_type</dt>
<dd><b>REQUIRED.</b> MUST be set to authorization_code.</dd>

<dt>code</dt>
<dd><b>REQUIRED.</b> The value of the code parameter returned in the authorization response.</dd>

<dt>client_assertion_type</dt>
<dd><b>REQUIRED.</b> MUST be set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer.</dd>

<dt>client_assertion</dt>
<dd><b>REQUIRED.</b> The value of the signed client authentication JWT generated as described below. The RP <b>MUST</b> generate a new <b>client</b>_assertion JWT for each call to the token endpoint.</dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**

In case the PKCE protocol was used by the Client in the relevant Authentication Request, the `code_verifier` element MUST be included.

<dl>

<dt>code_verifier</dt>
<dd><del>OPTIONAL. If</del> <b>REQUIRED in case</b> the PKCE protocol was used by the Client in the relevant Authentication Request, the code_verifier MUST be present and the value MUST be the original random code, used to create the hashed challenge in `code_challenge`.</dd>

</dl>

**/iGov-NL**

##  2.3. ID Tokens

All clients MUST validate the signature of an ID Token before accepting it
using the public key of the issuing server, which is published in JSON Web Key
(JWK) format. ID Tokens MAY be encrypted using the appropriate key of the
requesting client.

Clients MUST verify the following in received ID tokens:

<dl>

<dt>iss</dt>
<dd>The "issuer" field is the Uniform Resource Locat<del>e</del><b>o</b>r (URL) of the <del>expected issuer</del> <b>OpenID Provider</b></dd>

<dt>aud</dt>
<dd>The "audience" field contains the client ID(s) of the <del>client</del><b>Relying Party or Relying Parties. Any Relying Party MUST validate they are listed as audience for this ID-token.</b></dd>

<dt>exp, iat, nbf</dt>
<dd>The "expiration", "issued at", and "not before" timestamps for the token are dates (integer number of seconds since from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) within acceptable ranges<b>.</b></dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**
	
<dl>

<dt>nonce</dt>
<dd>The "nonce" field MUST be used by Clients to detect/prevent CSRF, replay and other attacks and Clients MUST verify that the nonce Claim Value is equal to the value of the nonce parameter sent in the Authentication Request.</dd>

<dt>acr</dt>
<dd>Client<b>s</b> MUST validate the authentication context class reference, if present, satisfies the minimum required before authorizing access to any resource or performing any operation on behalf of the identified subject.</dd>

</dl>

**/iGov-NL**


##  2.4. Request Objects

Clients MAY optionally send requests to the authorization endpoint using the
request parameter as defined by OpenID Connect . Clients MAY send requests to
the authorization endpoint by reference using the request_uri parameter.

Request objects MUST be signed by the client's registered key. Request objects
MAY be encrypted to the authorization server's public key.

**iGov-NL**

In case request objects using pass by reference are used, the `request_uri` parameter value MUST be pre-registered. The URI MUST be using either a URN or an absolute HTTPS URI, and MUST contain a sufficient amount of entropy to avoid guessing.
To avoid attacks by `request_uri` manipulation, the base value of the URI MUST be registered prior to usage and SHOULD be unambiguously distinct from other URIs in use. Since the `request_uri` should at the same time differ for each unique request due to caching considerations, a HTTPS URI MUST use a parameter identifying the request object.
The `request_uri` value MUST be reachable or retrievable by the OP. The server hosting the `request_uri` MAY require authentication of the OP.

**/iGov-NL**

##  2.5. **OpenID Provider** Discovery

**iGov-NL**

Clients and Resource Servers can use OpenID configuration published by OpenID Providers to obtain information 
about OpenID Provider configurations. 

**/iGov-NL**

Clients and protected resources SHOULD cache OpenID Provider metadata once an
OP has been discovered and used by the client **or resource server**.

**iGov-NL**

In case the OP uses the recommendations in this profile, caching information is provided through HTTP headers with the OpenID Provider metadata. It is therefor RECOMMENDED for clients and resource servers to use the HTTPS headers when determining validity of cached OP metadata.

## 2.6 Client Authentication and Registration

Clients SHOULD be able to perform dynamic registration. If dynamic registration is not supported, it is up to the discretion of the OP whether and up to what level of detail an alternative process is provided.
Pre-conditions to registration of Clients with the OP MAY be applicable, for various reasons such as organizational, legal, administrative, policy, security or technical reasons. Any such pre-conditions are out of scope of this profile.

Clients MUST be registered using the name of the responsible Service Provider and not any intermediary or supplier related names. The name MUST be familiar for the User and MUST be clearly and visibly shown to the User both at the RP's website and at the OP.

Authentication of the client using the private_key_jwt client authentication method MUST be supported. Alternative client authentication methods MAY be supported, provided they offer at least equivalent security.
NOTE: the client_secret_jwt method is not considered of equivalent security and the methods client_secret_basic and client_secret_post are obviously less secure. These three methods therefor MUST NOT be used.

### PKIoverheid
In case the Relying Party and OpenID Provider are not operated under responsibility of the same organization, each party MUST use PKIoverheid certificates with OIN.

PKIoverheid certificates MUST be included as `x5c` parameters in JWKs.
The `x5c` parameter MUST be included as a list (array) of X.509 certificate(s), as Base64 DER encoded PKIoverheid certificate(s).
The first certificate MUST be the Client's certificate, optionally followed by the rest of that certificate's chain.
The jwks structure MUST include the public key parameters with the same values of the corresponding X.509 certificate included as `x5c`, as per [RFC7517] §4.7.

**/iGov-NL**


#  3. OpenID Provider Profile

##  3.1. ID Tokens

All ID Tokens MUST be signed by the OpenID Provider's private signature key.
ID Tokens MAY be encrypted using the appropriate key of the requesting client.

~~The~~ ID Token**s** MUST expire and SHOULD have an active lifetime no longer than
five minutes. Since the ID token is consumed by the client and not presented
to remote systems, much shorter expiration times are RECOMMENDED where
possible.

The token response includes an access token (which can be used to make a
UserInfo request) and ID token (a signed and optionally encrypted JSON Web
Token). ID Token values have the following meanings:

<dl>

<dt>iss</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The "issuer" field is the Uniform Resource Locat<del>e</del><b>o</b>r (URL) of the <del>expected issuer</del> <b>OpenID Provider</b>.</dd>

<dt>aud</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The "audience" field contains the client ID(s) of the <del>client</del><b>Relying Party or Relying Parties</b>.</dd>

<dt>sub</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The identifier of the user. OpenID Providers MUST support a pairwise identifier in accordance with OpenID Connect section 8.1. See Pairwise Identifiers below on when it may be useful to relax this requirement.</dd>

**iGov-NL**

The parameters `vot` and `vtm` are not actively used in the iGov-NL profile, as Europe uses level-of-assurance (LoA) policies which fit best in `acr`.

**/iGov-NL**

<dl>

<dt>vot</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The vector value as specified in Vectors of Trust . See Vectors of Trust for more details. vot takes precedence over acr.</dd>

<dt>vtm</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED if vot is provided. The trustmark URI as specified in Vectors of Trust . See Vectors of Trust for more details.</dd>

<dt>acr</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The LoA the user was authenticated at. MUST be a member of the acr_values list from the authentication request <b>or that was agreed upon through other means</b>. The OpenID Provider MUST NOT include this field if vot is provided. See Authentication Context for more details.</dd>

<dt>nonce</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. MUST match the nonce value that was provided in the authentication request.</dd>

<dt>jti</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token.</dd>

<dt>auth_time</dt>
<dd>RECOMMENDED. This SHOULD be included if the <b>OpenID</b> Provider can assert an end-user's authentication intent was demonstrated. For example, a login event where the user took some action to authenticate.</dd>

<dt>exp, iat, nbf</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The "expiration", "issued at", and "not before" timestamps for the token are dates (integer number of seconds since from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) within acceptable ranges.</dd>

</dl>

This example ID token has been signed using the server's RSA key:

			"jti": "b42e57f8-4cfa-474a-afed-f0e9a77880c9"
          }

##  3.2. Pairwise Identifiers *and Public Identifiers*

Pairwise identifiers specified in OpenID Connect Core section 8 help protect
an end user's privacy by allowing an OpenID Provider to represent a single
user with a different subject identifier (sub) for every client the user
connects to. This technique can help mitigate correlation of a user between
multiple clients by preventing the clients from using the subject identifier
(the sub claim) to track a user between different sites and applications. Use
of pairwise identifiers does not prevent clients from correlating data based
on other identifying attributes such as names, phone numbers, email addresses,
document numbers, or other attributes. However, since not all transactions
require access to these attributes, but a subject identifier is always
required, a pairwise identifier will aid in protecting the privacy of end
users as they navigate the system.

OpenID Providers MUST support pairw~~a~~ise identifiers for cases where clients
require this functionality. OpenID Providers MAY support public identifiers ~~i~~
for frameworks where public identifiers are required, or for cases where
public identifiers are shared as attributes and the framework does not have a
requirement for subject anonymity.

**iGov-NL**

The Netherlands has standardized on using a citizen identification number
(_BurgerServiceNummer_ or BSN), for citizen to government related
interactions. Usage of the BSN is restricted by Dutch law. The BSN therefor
SHOULD be protected by additional security controls. For example, a BSN in
the `sub` parameter can be encrypted to the Relying Party.

A `sub` containing a BSN SHOULD be handled using `subject_type=public`.
For use cases where the BSN is not explicitly applicable, alternative
identifiers SHOULD be used. Such subject identifiers can be either public
or pairwise, depending on the identifier and use case. An OP conforming to
this profile SHOULD support public identifiers.

**/iGov-NL**


##  3.3. UserInfo Endpoint

OpenID Providers MUST support the UserInfo Endpoint and, at a minimum, the sub
(subject) claim. It is expected that the sub claim will remain pseudonymous in
use cases where obtaining personal information is not needed.

Support for a UserInfo Endpoint is important for maximum client implementation
interoperability even if no additional user information is returned. Clients
are not required to call the UserInfo Endpoint, but should not receive an
error if they do.

In an example transaction, the client sends a request to the UserInfo Endpoint
like the following:
    
    
		GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
		Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0MTg3MDI0MTIsIm
		 F1ZCI6WyJjMWJjODRlNC00N2VlLTRiNjQtYmI1Mi01Y2RhNmM4MWY3ODgiXSwiaXNzIjo

		Accept: text/plain, application/json, application/*+json, */*
		Host: op.example.nl
		Connection: Keep-Alive
    

And receives a document in response like the following:
    
    
		HTTP/1.1 200 OK
		Date: Tue, 16 Dec 2014 03:00:12 GMT
		Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
		Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1
		Content-Language: en-US
		Content-Length: 333
		Connection: close

		{
		   "sub": "6WZQPpnQxV",
		   "iss": "https://op.example.nl"
		   "given_name": "Stephen",
		   "family_name": "Emeritus",
		}
    

OpenID Providers MUST support the generation of JWT encoded responses from the
UserInfo Endpoint in addition to unsigned JSON objects. Signed responses MUST
be signed by the OpenID Provider's key, and encrypted responses MUST be
encrypted with the authorized client's public key. The OpenID Provider MUST
support the RS256 signature method (the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)
signature algorithm with a 256-bit hash) and MAY use other asymmetric
signature and encryption methods<b>, which provide equivalent or better security,</b> listed in the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
specification.

**iGov-NL**

In addition to RS256, OpenID Providers SHOULD support using the PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256) signature algorithm.

**/iGov-NL**

##  3.4. Request Objects

OpenID Providers MUST accept requests containing a request object signed by
the client's private key. Servers MUST validate the signature on such requests
against the client's registered public key. OpenID Connect Providers MUST
accept request objects encrypted with the server's public key.

OpenID Providers MAY accept request objects by reference using the request_uri
parameter.

Both of these methods allow for clients to create a request that is protected
from tampering through the browser, allowing for a higher security mode of
operation for clients and applications that require it. Clients are not
required to use request objects<b>.</b>~~, but~~ OpenID Providers ~~are required to~~ **MUST** support
requests using ~~them~~ **signed request objects passed by value, MAY 
support requests using signed request objects pass by reference and MAY support encryption of (signed) request objects**.

**iGov-NL**

In case request objects using pass by reference are used, the `request_uri` parameter value MUST be pre-registered. The URI MUST be using either a URN or an absolute HTTPS URI and MUST contain a sufficient amount of entropy to avoid guessing.
To avoid attacks by `request_uri` manipulation, the base value of the URI MUST be registered prior to usage and SHOULD be unambiguously distinct from other URIs in use.
The `request_uri` value MUST be reachable or retrievable by the OP. The OP MUST support authenticating to the server hosting the `request_uri`.

**/iGov-NL**


##  3.5. Vectors of Trust

**iGov-NL**

Vectors of Trust are not actively used in the iGov-NL profile, as Europe has standardized on level-of-assurance (LoA) policies under eIDAS which fit best in acr. Although vectors of trust provide more granularity and support for some anonymous use cases, these are less common in citizen-to-government use cases and therefor not applicable.

**/iGov-NL**

If the vtr (Vectors of Trust Request) value is present in the authorization
request as defined in the Vectors of Trust standard, the OpenID Provider
SHOULD respond with a valid vot value as defined in [section 3.1]. Both the
vtr and vot MUST contain values in accordance with the Vectors of Trust
standard. These values MAY be those defined in the Vectors of Trust standard
directly or MAY be from a compatible standard. The OpenID Provider MAY require
the user to re-authenticate, provide a second factor, or perform another
action in order to fulfill the state requested in the vtr.

For backwards compatibility clients MAY send an acr_values parameter. If both
the vtr and acr_values are in the request, the vtr MUST take precedence and
the acr_values MUST be ignored.

It is out of scope of this document to determine how an organization maps
their digital identity practices to valid VOT component values.

##  3.6. Authentication Context

OpenID Providers ~~MAY~~ **SHOULD** provide acr (authentication context class reference,
equivalent to the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) element of the
same name) and **MAY provide** amr (authentication methods reference) values in ID tokens only
if vtr is not used.

**iGov-NL**

As Europe has standardized on level-of-assurance (LoA) policies under eIDAS, the `acr` element is RECOMMENDED to be used. Valid values vary depending on context, use case and OpenID Providers in use. RECOMMENDED is to apply the three eIDAS LoAs (low, substantial and high), using the respective URIs defined by eIDAS as values.

**/iGov-NL**


##  3.7. Discovery

OpenID Connect Discovery ~~standard~~ **specifications** provides a standard, program**m**atic way for
clients to obtain configuration details for communicating with OpenID
Providers. Discovery is an important part of building scalable federation
ecosyst~~s~~ems.

Exposing a Discovery endpoint does NOT inherently put the OpenID Provider at
risk to attack. Endpoints and parameters specified in the Discovery document
SHOULD be considered public information regardless of the existence of the
Discovery document.

Access to the Discovery document MAY be protected with existing web
authentication methods if required by the **OpenID** Provider. Credentials for the
Discovery document are then managed by the **OpenID** Provider. Support for these
authentication methods is outside the scope of this specification.

Endpoints described in the Discovery document MUST be secured in accordance
with this specification and MAY have addit**i**onal controls the Provider wishes to
support.

All OpenID Providers are uniquely identified by a URL known as the issuer.
This URL serves as the prefix of a service discovery endpoint as specified in
the OpenID Connect Discovery ~~standard~~ **specification**. The discovery document MUST contain at
minimum the following fields:

<dl>

<dt>issuer</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The fully qualified issuer URL of the OpenID Provider. </dd>

<dt>authorization_endpoint</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The fully qualified URL of the OpenID Provider's authorization endpoint defined by [RFC6749].</dd>

<dt>token_endpoint</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The fully qualified URL of the server's token endpoint <b>as</b> defined by [RFC6749].</dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**

<dl>

<dt>userinfo_endpoint</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The fully qualified URL of the server's user info endpoint <b>as</b> defined by [OpenID.Discovery].</dd>

</dl>

**/iGov-NL**

<dl>

<dt>introspection_endpoint</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The fully qualified URL of the server's introspection endpoint <b>as</b> defined by OAuth Token Introspection.</dd>

<dt>revocation_endpoint</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The fully qualified URL of the server's revocation endpoint <b>as</b> defined by OAuth Token Revocation.</dd>

<dt>jwks_uri</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The fully qualified URI of the server's public key in JWK Set format. For verifying the signatures on the id_token.</dd>

<dt>scopes_supported</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The list of scopes, including iGov-<b>NL</b> scopes, the server supports.</dd>

<dt>response_types_supported</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. MUST be set to code, since only authorization code flow is supported by this profile.</dd>

<dt>claims_supported</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. The list of claims available in the supported scopes. See below.</dd>

<dt>vot</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The vectors supported.</dd>

<dt>acr_values_<b>supported</b></dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. The acr<bb> value</b>s supported.</dd>

</dl>

**iGov-NL**

In case the request objects using pass by reference are supported, registration of `request_uri` is required to avoid attacks using e.g. request rewrites or abuse of open redirectors.

<dl>

<dt>require_request_uri_registration</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. MUST be set to `true`. Either a URN or absolute HTTPS URI is required to be registered in case passing request objects by reference will be used.</dd>

</dl>

It is RECOMMENDED that servers provide cache information through HTTP headers
and make the cache valid for at least one week.


**iGov-NL**

### PKIoverheid
In case the Relying Party and OpenID Provider are not operated under responsibility of the same organization, each party MUST use PKIoverheid certificates with OIN.

The PKIoverheid certificate MUST be included as a `x5c` parameter.
The `x5c` parameter MUST be included as a list (array) of X.509 certificate(s), as Base64 DER encoded PKIoverheid certificate(s).
The first certificate MUST be the Client's certificate, optionally followed by the rest of that certificate's chain.
The jwks structure MUST include the public key parameters with the same values of the corresponding X.509 certificate included as `x5c`, as per [RFC7517] §4.7.

### JWKS

**/iGov-NL**

The server MUST provide its public key in JWK Set format, such as the
following 2048-bit RSA key:

##  3.8. Dynamic **Client** Registration

If the OP is acting as an iGov-**NL** OAuth Authorization Server (iGov-**NL** OAuth2
profile), then Dynamic Registration MUST be supported in accordance with that
specification (see section ~~3.13~~ **1.4.1.3**).

#  4. User Info

The availability, quality, and reliability of an individual's identity
attributes will vary greatly across jurisdictions and **OpenID** Provider systems. The
following recommendations **aims to** ensure maximum cross-jurisdictional
interoperability, while setting Client expectations on the type of data they
may acquire.

##  4.1. Claims Supported

Discovery mandates the inclusion of the claims_supported field that defines
the claims a client MAY expect to receive for the supported scopes. OpenID
Providers MUST return claims on a best effort basis. However, a **OpenID** Provider
asserting it can provide a user claim does not imply that this data is
available for all its users: clients MUST be prepared to receive partial data.
Providers MAY return claims outside of the claims_supported list, but they
MUST still ensure that the extra claims to not violate the privacy policies
set out by the federation.

##  4.2. Scope Profiles

In the interests of data minimization<b>,</b> balanced with the requirement to
successfully identify the individual signing in to a service, the default
OpenID Connect profiles may not be appropriate.

Matching of the identity assertion based on claims to a local identifier or
'account' related to the individual identity at a level of assurance is a
requirement where the government in question is not able to provide a single
identifier for all citizens based on an authoritative register of citizens.

The requirement for matching is also of importance where a cross-border or
cross-jurisdiction authentication is required and therefore the availability
of a single identifier (e.g. social security number) cannot be guaranteed for
the individual wishing to authenticate.

This standard defines a set of common scope values that aim to provide maximum
cross-jurisdictional identity matching while not being p**re**scriptive on the
exact attributes shared, as every jurisdiction will likely have vari**o**us levels
of information available, and different policies for sharing personal data
even if it is on file.


<dl>

<dt>profile</dt>
<dd>The OpenID Connect Core defined profile provides baseline identity information. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that the attributes for given_name, family_name, address, birthdate be supported by iGov Providers if possible, unless data quality requirements or privacy considerations prevent it. It is left to the OpenID Provider and the trust framework to set any further limitations on this profile data - see Privacy Considerations below.</dd>

</dl>


**iGov-NL**

As the Netherlands has standardized on using a citizen identification number (_BurgerServiceNummer_ or BSN), directly referencing document numbers is discouraged in the iGov-NL profile. Usage of `doc` claims in the Netherlands is NOT RECOMMENDED.

**/iGov-NL**

<dl>

<dt>doc</dt>
<dd>The identity document type(s) and associated "number" the Provider is capable of providing. Mu<del>t</del>l<b>t</b>iple document types MAY be returned. This could be passport, driver's license, national ID card, health insurance no., and so on. See the Claims below for the document claims available.</dd>

</dl>

##  4.3. Claims Request

[OpenID.Core] section 5.5 defines a method for a client to request specific
claims in the UserInfo object. OpenID Providers MUST support this claims
parameter in the interest of data minimization - that is, the **OpenID** Provider only
returns information on the subject the client specifically asks for, and does
not volunteer additon**i**al information about the subject.

Clients requesting the profile scope MAY provide a claims request parameter.
If the claims request is omitted, the OpenID Provider SHOULD provide a default
claims set that it has available for the subject, in accordance with any
policies set out by the trust framework the Provider supports.

**iGov-NL**

As the Netherlands has standardized on using a citizen identification number (_BurgerServiceNummer_ or BSN), directly referencing document numbers is discouraged in the iGov-NL profile. Usage of the `doc` claims in the Netherlands is NOT RECOMMENDED.

**/iGov-NL**

Client**s** requesting the doc scope MUST provide a claims request parameter
indicating the document type (or types) and fields they wish to receive, or
they will receive none. The OpenID Provider MUST NOT return any doc related
claims not included in the claims request. Client requests that include the
doc scope but no claims request MUST NOT be rejected by the OpenID Provider,
but simply no doc related claims are returned in the UserInfo object.

##  4.4. ~~Claims~~ **UserInfo** Response

Response to a UserInfo request MUST match the scope and claims requested to
avoid having a OpenID Provider over-expose a user's identity information.

**iGov-NL**

As the Netherlands has standardized on using a citizen identification number (_BurgerServiceNummer_ or BSN), directly referencing document numbers is discouraged in the iGov-NL profile. Usage of the `doc` claims in the Netherlands is NOT RECOMMENDED.

**/iGov-NL**

The document doc claims response include:

<dl>

<dt>type</dt>
<dd>The document type.</dd>

<dt>num</dt>
<dd>The value of the document identifier. Note that not all values are technically numeric.</dd>

<dt>issued</dt>
<dd>The date the document was issued. Timestamp format.</dd>

<dt>expires</dt>
<dd>The date the document expires (or expired). Timestamp format.</dd>

<dt>issuer_location</dt>
<dd>The location/address of the issuing agency.</dd>

</dl>

Claims response MAY also make use of the agg**r**egated and/or distributed claims
structure to refer to the original source of the subject's claims.

##  4.5. Claims Metadata

Claims Metadata (such as locale or the confidence level the OpenID Provider
has in the claim for the user) can be expressed as attributes within the
UserInfo object, but are outside the scope of this document. These types of
claims are best described by the trust framework the clients and OpenID
Providers operate within.

#  5. Privacy Considerations

**iGov-NL**

All parties implementing this specification MUST ensure that due care is 
taken to protect user privacy.

**/iGov-NL**

Data minimization is an essential concept in trust frameworks and federations
exchanging user identity information for government applications. The design
of this specification takes into consideration mechanisms to protect the
user's government identity information and activity from unintentional
exposure.

Pairwise anonymous identifiers MUST be supported by the OpenID Providers for
~~frameworks~~ **cases** where subjects should not be traceable across clients by their
subject ~~ID~~ **identifiers**. This prevents a situation where a user may inadvertently be
assigned a universal government identifier.

Request claims MUST be supported by the OpenID Providers to ensure that only
the data the client explicitly requests is provided in the UserInfo response.
This prevents situations where a client may only require a partial set of
claims, but receives (and is therefore exposed to) a full set of claims. ~~For
example, if a client only needs a single government document type and number,
the OpenID Provider MUST NOT send the client the full document information,
possibly from multiple documents.~~

Despite the mechanisms enforced by this specification, the operational
circumstances of a federation may allow these controls to be relaxed. For
example, if a framework always requires clients to request a national ID
number, then the pairwise anonymous identif**i**er requirement may be relaxed. ~~In
cases where all clients are entitled to all government document claims
associated to a subject at an OpenID Provider, the claims request requirement
may be relaxed.~~

The reasons for relaxing the controls that support data minimalization are
outside the scope of this specification.

#  6. Security Considerations

All transactions MUST be protected in transit ~~by~~**using** TLS as described in BCP195.

**iGov-NL**

In addition to the Best Current Practice for TLS, it is highly RECOMMENDED for all conforming implementations to incorporate the TLS guidelines from the Dutch NCSC [NCSC.TLS] into their implementations. If these guidelines are applied:
* For back-channel communication, the guidelines categorized as "good" MUST be applied.
* For front-channel communication, the guidelines for "good" MUST be applied and the guidelines for "sufficient" MAY be applied, depending on target audience and support requirements.
* Guidelines categorized as "insufficient" MUST NOT be applied and those categorized as "phase out" SHOULD NOT be used.

**/iGov-NL**

All clients MUST conform to applicable recommendations found in the Security
Considerations sections of [RFC6749] and those found in the OAuth 2.0 Threat
Model and Security Considerations document.

# Appendix A. Future updates

The following updates are foreseen to be made in future updates to this profile. These are not yet part of the profile.

## Client Authentication using Mutual TLS
Instead of, or in addition to, the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method, mutual authenticated TLS MAY be used. This currently is specified in draft by IETF, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-13.
As result of this addition, the following changes SHOULD be anticipated:
* Addition of a `client_id` parameter in token Requests, instead of a `client_assertion` and `client_assertion_type`.
* Option for Clients to support `tls_client_auth` instead of or in addition to `private_key_jwt`.
* Requirement on OPs to support for `tls_client_auth` client authentication method next to `private_key_jwt`.
